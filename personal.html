                    <h1>Who is Parker Spaan</h1>
                    <p>This website was a passion project inbetween semesters while in my undergrad <br> 
                        Unlike most of my peers I did not learn to code before entering college as this was not something anyone in my family had any interest or real idea of. <br>
                        I was brought up to be an engineer, working on engines, suspension, and other mechanical systems. From dirtbikes to cars, skateboards, and anything else that could move me from one place to another. <br> 
                        Fortunately for me, I was shown programming early on in my college career and got to see another way of problem solving. Now not only could I work to build and fix mechanical systems, but I could also work to build and fix digital systems. <br>
                        This opened up an entirely new world and ability to problem solve in a multitude of ways.<br>
                        This website is to give a brief introduction and show a very small example of what I have learned just within the world of computers. <br>
